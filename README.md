### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm just a !normal Software Engineer, I'm always curious about how things work and why it works. I've being coding since I was 15, I got my first job at 19, When I'm free, I work on side projects or learn new skills, When my brain is like: "brah, can I have a break", I watch Movies/TV Shows, or play games.
